Hin Ming Frankie Chik

I am a doctoral student in East Asian Languages and Civilizations at Arizona State University. My research interest covers the intellectual and cultural history in early to medieval China. My dissertation will examine the studies of ancient bronzes in Song China and investigate how could such studies assist scholars to revivie the golden antiquity. I am also taking the Digital Humainities certificate at ASU. I hope that the DH knowledge will be applied to my research.
